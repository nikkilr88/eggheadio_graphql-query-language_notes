# 15. Explore Refactored GraphQL Queries

Our refactored pet library just got some new queries and can be found at [https://funded-pet-library.moonhighway.com/](https://funded-pet-library.moonhighway.com/).

With the updates, we can now query `totalPets`, `availablePets`, `checkedOutPets` and `customersWithPets` without any additional filters. ðŸŽ‰

```graphql
query {
  customersWithPets {
    username
    name
  }
  totalPets
  availablePets
  checkedOutPets
}
```
